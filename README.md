## You win some, you lose some: Our Inspiration
If you fell for that, don't worry -- you're not alone. Thousands of people are victims are social media scams each year. In fact, over [$770 million](https://www.investopedia.com/social-media-scams-surging-5217274) were reported lost in 2021 alone. Trust us, we've been there. As someone who has been scammed twice out of football tickets on FaceBook by scammers posed as college students, I've learned to reverify the name and email with the student directory before engaging. However, this process is quite tedious, and I've always longed for a site where we can authenticate real students with real tickets. And to make matters worse, we often have to resort to FaceBook because of it's large platform. However, this madhacks, we decided to be vigilant and personally create a marketplace site -- by college students, for college students. We may have lost some football tikets, but we're winning a ticket to first prize today ðŸ˜‰.

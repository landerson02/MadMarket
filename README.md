## You win some, you lose some: Our Inspiration
If you fell for that, don't worry -- you're not alone. Thousands of people are victims are social media scams each year. In fact, over [$770 million](https://www.investopedia.com/social-media-scams-surging-5217274) were reported lost in 2021 alone. Trust us, we've been there. As someone who has been scammed twice out of football tickets on FaceBook by scammers posed as college students, I've learned to reverify the name and email with the student directory before engaging. However, this process is rather tedious, and I've always longed for a site where we can authenticate real students with real tickets. And to make matters worse, we often have to resort to FaceBook because of it's large platform. However, this madhacks, we decided to be vigilant and personally create a marketplace site -- by college students, for college students. We may have lost some football tikets, but we're winning a ticket to first prize today ðŸ˜‰.

## A marketplace without a checkout?
On the surface, our website might look pretty familiar to any other online shopping websites/marketplaces. We have 6 main categories of items (tickets, appliances, furniture, subleases, clothing, technology), and 1 miscellaneous tab. We based these categories by going through and counting the most popular listings, as well as surveying friends about what they tend to look for online. All posts are featured within these categories, and are updated real time as users submit new ones. However, you might notice one thing quite particular -- where is the checkout?! Because these sellers and buyers are verified students, we encourage buyers to connect with the sellers via student email and vice versa. This way, both parties can feel safe knowing that the person on the other side are authentic. Also [reseach](https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/JCM-09-2021-4877/full/html) has found that sellers and buyers who communicate beforehand have left with a more satisfied exchange than doing a cold transaction (ie giving the buyer a chance to negotiating but also giving the seller the chance to counter/justify). Instead of a traditional checkout, we have a "Saved" tab; where students are able to keep track of their favorite listings and contact the sellers!
